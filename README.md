# Typescript_

Types in TypeScript are used to define the type of variables, function parameters and object properties. TypeScript is a statically typed language, which means that the type of a variable is known at compile time.

## Basic Types

Number - All numbers, no differentiation between integers or floats
String - All text values
Boolean - true or false
Array - Any JavaScript array, type can be flexible or strict
Tuple - Added by TypeScript: Fixed length array
Enum - Added by TypeScript: Automatically enumerated global constant identifiers
Null - Null value
Undefined - Undefined value
Void - Absence of having any type at all
Any - Any kind of value, no specific type assignment // it also can be used to ignore the type checking
Never - Represents the type of values that never occur
Unknown - Represents the type-safe counterpart of any
Object - Represents any non-primitive type
